# This file is where you keep secret settings, passwords, and tokens!
# If you put them in the code you risk committing that info or sharing it

# Notes
# Defining channel speeds access and reduces power if you know the WiFi Channel
# Defining timeout sets the amount of time to wait for a WiFi access request, also affects power consumption
# Change as needed and remove what you don't use
